						<p>YANGON: US President Barack Obama urged Myanmar on Friday (Nov 14) to hold "free, fair and inclusive" elections as he threw his weight behind a bid by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to change a constitution that bars her from the presidency. Obama held talks with fellow Nobel laureate Suu Kyi at her lakeside villa in Myanmar's commercial capital Yangon, after arriving from the capital Nay Pyi Taw where he discussed the nation's troubled reform process with President Thein Sein.</p>

						<p>Speaking at a joint press conference he warned Myanmar's reforms since shedding outright military rule in 2011 were by "no means complete or irreversible" and called for "free, fair and inclusive" elections in the nation, where Suu Kyi and her party are set to contest crucial polls next year.</p>

						<p>Suu Kyi, who has publicly stated her desire to be president, is barred from the top office by a constitutional clause ruling out anyone with foreign spouse or children from the presidency. Her late husband and two sons are British and the democracy champion is seeking an amendment.</p>

						<p>Using strong language, Obama took up the issue telling reporters that "the amendment process needs to reflect inclusion rather than exclusion". "I don't understand the provision that would bar somebody from running for president because of who his children are."</p>

						<p>Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy (NLD) party is widely expected to sweep polls in late 2015, branded the contentious clause as "unfair, unjust and undemocratic", adding "it is not right to discriminate against one particular citizen".</p>

						<p>The issue is currently being debated in parliament, where 25 per cent of the seats are ring-fenced for the military. "The majority of our people understand that this constitution cannot stand as it is," if democracy is to be achieved, the democracy figurehead added. The pair spoke in the garden of Suu Kyi's villa in a reprise of their landmark meeting in 2012, which saw the US leader throw his political might behind Myanmar's transition from military rule.</p>

						<p>After talks with his counterpart Thein Sein late Thursday Obama expressed cautious optimism for the once-cloistered nation that balanced out earlier warnings on the risks of "backsliding" on the transition. "We recognise change is hard and you do not always move in a straight line but I'm optimistic," Obama said.<p/>

						<p>During his two-night trip to Myanmar, the US leader has also raised alarm over the direction of reforms, however, citing the cramping of freedom of expression, ongoing conflicts and the treatment of Myanmar's minority groups - especially the Muslim Rohingya.</p>

						<h4>STALLED REFORMS</h4>

						<p>Obama was whisked from Yangon airport to tour the British colonial-era secretariat building in downtown Yangon where Suu Kyi's father, independence hero General Aung San, was gunned down by political rivals in 1947.</p>

						<p>Their talks at Suu Kyi's lakeside family home come almost four years to the day after she was released from years of house arrest. Her street, which also houses the US Embassy, was sealed off Friday with dozens of police at each end as well as a scrum of reporters and cameramen and some NLD members.</p>

						<p>He then moved to university compound for a town hall style question-and-answer session where the serious political discussion was punctuated by peels of laughter as a relaxed Obama took off his jacket and bantered with the mainly young audience. Several among the crowd briefly held up banners reading "reform is fake", prompting a riposte from the US leader who said "Oh we have some signs ... that's why we are here, to talk."</p>

						<p>On his last visit, Obama received a fanfare welcome from thrilled locals a year after Thein Sein began to open up the country. Most political prisoners have been released and by-elections have seen Suu Kyi become a lawmaker, while foreign investors have arrived in lockstep with the lifting of most sanctions.</p>

						<p>But the atmosphere has slowly soured, with many observers saying reforms have stalled and this time there was little of the streetside cheering for Obama. Even Sui Kyi's star power earned as the torch-bearer of democracy during the dark junta years having waned in the eyes of some as she has embedded herself as a politician rather than resistance figure.</p>

						<p>For his part, Obama has been battered domestically with poor approval numbers compounded by a thumping defeat for his Democrats in last week's mid-term elections. His next stop is Brisbane for talks with G20 leaders. </p>

						<p>SINGAPORE: SingTel has reported a 19 per cent increase in net profit for second quarter earnings, saying it was the result of "underlying strength in its core business, strong execution and continued investments in strategic initiatives".</p>

						<p>The telco announced in a press release on Thursday (Nov 13) that it posted a net profit of S$1.04 billion for the three months ended September. Underlying net profit increased 11 per cent to S$979 million, which excludes a net exceptional gain of S$59 million which arose mainly from the dilution of SingTel’s equity stake in SingPost.</p> 

						<p>Its revenue grew 4 per cent to S$4.31 billion.</p>

						<p>SingTel says it saw improvements across all its businesses, including ICT services and digital marketing revenue, and growth in mobile data. Its Singapore consumer business was supported by fibre broadband and mio-TV strategies.</p>

						<p>Meanwhile, its regional mobile associates posted robust profit growth of 21.7 per cent year-on-year. SingTel says it expects to see continued growth in its developing markets.</p>

						<p>Group CEO of SingTel Chua Sock Koong, said: "There's been a strong take up in data, so while voice continues to grow nicely, in many of these markets, data has now become the key driver of growth. You see that across India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand as well.</p>

						<p>"Bharti saw 130 per cent increase in profits, and that's despite continued weakness in Africa. India's performance has really come through. Globe is another stand-out performance for this quarter," he added.</p>

						<p>SingTel also said that it will be creating new revenue streams and enhancing its core business by launching new digital initiatives such as in data analytics.</p>

						<h4>DIGITAL LIFE STILL STRUGGLING</h4>

						<p>The telco's Digital Life business segment continued to struggle, with losses growing 26 per cent from a year ago, despite an increase in revenue of 142 per cent. Losses increased with new investments and initiatives in m-commerce, video and analytics.</p>

						<p>SingTel said it remains focused on building its capabilities in digital marketing and video, and data analytics, particularly through recent acquisitions of two digital marketing firms - Konterra and Adconion.</p>

						<p>"With that we've transformed Amobee which we acquired two years ago from being a mobile advertising company to a digital marketing technology company. With these acquisitions we expect Digital L!fe revenue to exceed S$300 million for the year, losses will widen - we're talking about S$200 to S$250 million. That's largely because we're continuing to invest to grow the company," Mr Chua said.</p>

						<p>SingTel is maintaining its guidance for the current financial year ending March 2015, with the group's consolidated revenue and EBITDA, excluding acquisitions, expected to be stable.</p>

						<p>SINGAPORE: SingTel on Friday (Oct 24) started offering Apple's latest iPads - the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 - while competing telco StarHub said it would start sales for the two devices from Saturday.</p>

						<p>SingTel will offer the Wi-Fi plus Cellular variants of the Cupertino firm's latest tablet devices with its mobile broadband bundles, combining either a 5GB or 10GB data cap with 2GB SingTel Wi-Fi data allowance.</p>

						<p>Apart from the monthly subscription, customers who buy the devices from SingTel will have to pay S$15 per month for 24 months - to defray the high upfront fee, a company spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia.</p>

						<p>This top-up payment plan is compulsory "for this round of sales", and the telco will evaluate down the road to see if will continue making it compulsory or offer it as an opt-in feature. The spokesperson added that this is the first time a local telco has offered such a top-up payment scheme.</p>

						<p>Consumers can visit SingTel's portal, www.singtel.com/ipadupdates, for more information on pricing and availability.</p>

						<p>Rival StarHub also announced on Friday it would start selling the two devices from Saturday, although the iPad Air 2 is only available at Plaza Singapura, Marina Bay Link and VivoCity StarHub shops. More information can be found at its portal, http://www.starhub.com/ipad.html.</p>

						<p>The prices for both devices from StarHub can be found below:</p>

						<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 13, 2014 (AFP) - Twitter shares soared on Wednesday as the popular social network evidently won over Wall Street analysts with its battle plan for winning users and revenue.</p>

						<p>Twitter shares were up more than seven per cent to US$42.54 (S$54.89) at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and inched a bit higher in after-market trades.</p>

						<p>The boost came as the one-to-many messaging service hosted its first analysts day at a San Francisco hotel and unveiled changes on the way in the coming year.</p>

						<p>Plans include giving every newcomer an instant, personalized timeline to make it more enticing for those inclined to simply view messages to become active members of the service, Twitter vice president of product Kevin Weil said in a blog post.</p>

						</p>Twitter told analysts about 500 million people visit the service without logging into accounts.</p>

						<p>"Ultimately, we believe there is something for everyone at any time on Twitter, and we want to make finding your niche simple from the start," Weil said.</p>

						<h4>Spotlighting miss 'tweets'</h4>

						<p>Twitter is also developing ways to spotlight interesting 'tweets' people missed while away from the service, which is known for its real-time torrent of messages.</p>

						<p>Even the most adept Twitter user is hard pressed to find every relevant message among the hundreds of millions of 'tweets' fired off daily at the service, Weil reasoned.</p>

						<p>"That's why we're exploring ways to surface relevant Tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover - whether you stay on Twitter all day or visit for a few minutes - while still preserving the real-time nature of the platform that makes Twitter special," Weil said.</p>

						<p>Information such as who Twitter users follow or engage with at the service can be part of a formula for providing them with "snapshots" of what is happening at any given time, according to Weil.</p>

						<p>Enhancements coming to direct messaging at Twitter will make it easier to take public exchanges private, according to the service.</p>

						<p>Twitter also told of plans to enhance video capabilities at the service.</p>
