						<p>YANGON: US President Barack Obama urged Myanmar on Friday (Nov 14) to hold "free, fair and inclusive" elections as he threw his weight behind a bid by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to change a constitution that bars her from the presidency. Obama held talks with fellow Nobel laureate Suu Kyi at her lakeside villa in Myanmar's commercial capital Yangon, after arriving from the capital Nay Pyi Taw where he discussed the nation's troubled reform process with President Thein Sein.</p>

						<p>Speaking at a joint press conference he warned Myanmar's reforms since shedding outright military rule in 2011 were by "no means complete or irreversible" and called for "free, fair and inclusive" elections in the nation, where Suu Kyi and her party are set to contest crucial polls next year.</p>

						<p>Suu Kyi, who has publicly stated her desire to be president, is barred from the top office by a constitutional clause ruling out anyone with foreign spouse or children from the presidency. Her late husband and two sons are British and the democracy champion is seeking an amendment.</p>

						<p>Using strong language, Obama took up the issue telling reporters that "the amendment process needs to reflect inclusion rather than exclusion". "I don't understand the provision that would bar somebody from running for president because of who his children are."</p>

						<p>Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy (NLD) party is widely expected to sweep polls in late 2015, branded the contentious clause as "unfair, unjust and undemocratic", adding "it is not right to discriminate against one particular citizen".</p>

						<p>The issue is currently being debated in parliament, where 25 per cent of the seats are ring-fenced for the military. "The majority of our people understand that this constitution cannot stand as it is," if democracy is to be achieved, the democracy figurehead added. The pair spoke in the garden of Suu Kyi's villa in a reprise of their landmark meeting in 2012, which saw the US leader throw his political might behind Myanmar's transition from military rule.</p>

						<p>After talks with his counterpart Thein Sein late Thursday Obama expressed cautious optimism for the once-cloistered nation that balanced out earlier warnings on the risks of "backsliding" on the transition. "We recognise change is hard and you do not always move in a straight line but I'm optimistic," Obama said.<p/>

						<p>During his two-night trip to Myanmar, the US leader has also raised alarm over the direction of reforms, however, citing the cramping of freedom of expression, ongoing conflicts and the treatment of Myanmar's minority groups - especially the Muslim Rohingya.</p>

						<h4>STALLED REFORMS</h4>

						<p>Obama was whisked from Yangon airport to tour the British colonial-era secretariat building in downtown Yangon where Suu Kyi's father, independence hero General Aung San, was gunned down by political rivals in 1947.</p>

						<p>Their talks at Suu Kyi's lakeside family home come almost four years to the day after she was released from years of house arrest. Her street, which also houses the US Embassy, was sealed off Friday with dozens of police at each end as well as a scrum of reporters and cameramen and some NLD members.</p>

						<p>He then moved to university compound for a town hall style question-and-answer session where the serious political discussion was punctuated by peels of laughter as a relaxed Obama took off his jacket and bantered with the mainly young audience. Several among the crowd briefly held up banners reading "reform is fake", prompting a riposte from the US leader who said "Oh we have some signs ... that's why we are here, to talk."</p>

						<p>On his last visit, Obama received a fanfare welcome from thrilled locals a year after Thein Sein began to open up the country. Most political prisoners have been released and by-elections have seen Suu Kyi become a lawmaker, while foreign investors have arrived in lockstep with the lifting of most sanctions.</p>

						<p>But the atmosphere has slowly soured, with many observers saying reforms have stalled and this time there was little of the streetside cheering for Obama. Even Sui Kyi's star power earned as the torch-bearer of democracy during the dark junta years having waned in the eyes of some as she has embedded herself as a politician rather than resistance figure.</p>

						<p>For his part, Obama has been battered domestically with poor approval numbers compounded by a thumping defeat for his Democrats in last week's mid-term elections. His next stop is Brisbane for talks with G20 leaders. </p>

						<p>SINGAPORE: SingTel has reported a 19 per cent increase in net profit for second quarter earnings, saying it was the result of "underlying strength in its core business, strong execution and continued investments in strategic initiatives".</p>

						<p>The telco announced in a press release on Thursday (Nov 13) that it posted a net profit of S$1.04 billion for the three months ended September. Underlying net profit increased 11 per cent to S$979 million, which excludes a net exceptional gain of S$59 million which arose mainly from the dilution of SingTel’s equity stake in SingPost.</p> 

						<p>Its revenue grew 4 per cent to S$4.31 billion.</p>

						<p>SingTel says it saw improvements across all its businesses, including ICT services and digital marketing revenue, and growth in mobile data. Its Singapore consumer business was supported by fibre broadband and mio-TV strategies.</p>

						<p>Meanwhile, its regional mobile associates posted robust profit growth of 21.7 per cent year-on-year. SingTel says it expects to see continued growth in its developing markets.</p>

						<p>Group CEO of SingTel Chua Sock Koong, said: "There's been a strong take up in data, so while voice continues to grow nicely, in many of these markets, data has now become the key driver of growth. You see that across India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand as well.</p>

						<p>"Bharti saw 130 per cent increase in profits, and that's despite continued weakness in Africa. India's performance has really come through. Globe is another stand-out performance for this quarter," he added.</p>

						<p>SingTel also said that it will be creating new revenue streams and enhancing its core business by launching new digital initiatives such as in data analytics.</p>

						<h4>DIGITAL LIFE STILL STRUGGLING</h4>

						<p>The telco's Digital Life business segment continued to struggle, with losses growing 26 per cent from a year ago, despite an increase in revenue of 142 per cent. Losses increased with new investments and initiatives in m-commerce, video and analytics.</p>

						<p>SingTel said it remains focused on building its capabilities in digital marketing and video, and data analytics, particularly through recent acquisitions of two digital marketing firms - Konterra and Adconion.</p>

						<p>"With that we've transformed Amobee which we acquired two years ago from being a mobile advertising company to a digital marketing technology company. With these acquisitions we expect Digital L!fe revenue to exceed S$300 million for the year, losses will widen - we're talking about S$200 to S$250 million. That's largely because we're continuing to invest to grow the company," Mr Chua said.</p>

						<p>SingTel is maintaining its guidance for the current financial year ending March 2015, with the group's consolidated revenue and EBITDA, excluding acquisitions, expected to be stable.</p>

						<p>SINGAPORE: SingTel on Friday (Oct 24) started offering Apple's latest iPads - the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 - while competing telco StarHub said it would start sales for the two devices from Saturday.</p>

						<p>SingTel will offer the Wi-Fi plus Cellular variants of the Cupertino firm's latest tablet devices with its mobile broadband bundles, combining either a 5GB or 10GB data cap with 2GB SingTel Wi-Fi data allowance.</p>

						<p>Apart from the monthly subscription, customers who buy the devices from SingTel will have to pay S$15 per month for 24 months - to defray the high upfront fee, a company spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia.</p>

						<p>This top-up payment plan is compulsory "for this round of sales", and the telco will evaluate down the road to see if will continue making it compulsory or offer it as an opt-in feature. The spokesperson added that this is the first time a local telco has offered such a top-up payment scheme.</p>

						<p>Consumers can visit SingTel's portal, www.singtel.com/ipadupdates, for more information on pricing and availability.</p>

						<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 13, 2014 (AFP) - Twitter shares soared on Wednesday as the popular social network evidently won over Wall Street analysts with its battle plan for winning users and revenue.</p>

						<p>Twitter shares were up more than seven per cent to US$42.54 (S$54.89) at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and inched a bit higher in after-market trades.</p>

						<p>The boost came as the one-to-many messaging service hosted its first analysts day at a San Francisco hotel and unveiled changes on the way in the coming year.</p>

						<p>Plans include giving every newcomer an instant, personalized timeline to make it more enticing for those inclined to simply view messages to become active members of the service, Twitter vice president of product Kevin Weil said in a blog post.</p>

						</p>Twitter told analysts about 500 million people visit the service without logging into accounts.</p>

						<p>"Ultimately, we believe there is something for everyone at any time on Twitter, and we want to make finding your niche simple from the start," Weil said.</p>

						<h4>Spotlighting miss 'tweets'</h4>

						<p>Twitter is also developing ways to spotlight interesting 'tweets' people missed while away from the service, which is known for its real-time torrent of messages.</p>

						<p>Even the most adept Twitter user is hard pressed to find every relevant message among the hundreds of millions of 'tweets' fired off daily at the service, Weil reasoned.</p>

						<p>"That's why we're exploring ways to surface relevant Tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover - whether you stay on Twitter all day or visit for a few minutes - while still preserving the real-time nature of the platform that makes Twitter special," Weil said.</p>

						<p>Information such as who Twitter users follow or engage with at the service can be part of a formula for providing them with "snapshots" of what is happening at any given time, according to Weil.</p>

						<p>Enhancements coming to direct messaging at Twitter will make it easier to take public exchanges private, according to the service.</p>

						<p>Twitter also told of plans to enhance video capabilities at the service.</p>

						<p>DARMSTADT, Germany: European scientists were hoping for a stream of data Thursday after a robot lab made the first-ever landing on a comet, a key step in a marathon mission to probe the mysteries of space.</p>

						<p>Operation chiefs in Darmstadt, Germany, on Wednesday (Nov 12) said the lander Philae failed to anchor to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on landing, but still managed to send back scientific information. The 100kg explorer may have plopped down in a soft, sand-like material or may be lightly touching the surface, they speculated.</p>

						<p>More would be known on Thursday when Philae makes scheduled contact with its mothership, Rosetta, landing manager Stephan Ulamec said. "Hopefully, we are sitting there on the surface at a position different to the original landing and can continue our science," Ulamec said. The agency was to brief the press at 9pm (Singapore time).</p>

						<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) is ecstatic at the operation and NASA - the world's most successful space agency and an expert at difficult landings - itself heaped praise on the exploit. Equipped with 10 instruments, Philae was designed to carry out the first-ever scientific experiments on a comet, providing the jewel in a crown of a massively complicated project more than two decades in the making.</p>

						<p>Getting from Earth to a comet that is travelling towards the Sun at 18 kilometres per second was a landmark in space engineering and celestial mathematics. The €1.3 billion (US$1.6-billion) Rosetta mission was approved in 1993. Rosetta, carrying Philae, was hoisted into space in 2004, and took more than a decade to reach its target in August this year, having used the gravitational pull of Earth and Mars as slingshots to build up speed. The pair covered 6.5 billion kilometres together before Wednesday's separation prior to landing.</p>

						<p>Seen by the superstitious as harbingers of good or evil, comets are viewed by astrophysicists as time capsules of the nascent Solar System. They comprise ancient ice and dust, the rubble of the material that went into the making of the planets 4.6 billion years ago. According to one hypothesis, they may have given Earth the gift of life by pounding it with ice that made the oceans and carbon molecules that provided the building blocks of organisms.</p>

						<p>Philae was designed to come into land at a gentle 3.5 kmh, then fire two harpoons into a surface that engineers hoped would provide sufficient grip while the robot conducts its experiments. However there were indications that these landing harpoons had failed to deploy, ground control said. Envisaged tests include drilling through the comet surface and analysing the samples for chemical signatures.</p>

						<h4>SCIENCE GOALS</h4>

						<p>In Toulouse, France, astrophysicist Philippe Gaudon, who heads the Rosetta mission at French space agency CNES, said it would be difficult for Philae to drill if it was not secured. "However, Philae has not tipped over and seems to be stabilising," Gaudon said. "And a certain number of instruments are continuing to operate, mainly for measuring temperature, vibration, magnetism and so on."</p>

						<p>Philae is designed to operate for about 60 hours on a stored battery charge, but several months more if it can get replenishment from sunlight. The lander complements 11 instruments aboard Rosetta, a three-tonne orbiter that is doing four-fifths of the expected scientific programme from orbit. Whatever happens to Philae, Rosetta will continue to escort the comet as it loops around the Sun.</p>

						<p>On August 13, 2015, "67P" will come within 186 million kilometres of the star. The mission is scheduled to end in December 2015, when the comet heads out of the inner Solar System. At this point, Rosetta will once again come close to Earth's orbit, more than 4,000 days after launch.</p>

						<p>BILASPUR: India has defended a state-run programme that offers poor women cash incentives to get sterilised after the deaths of 13 women triggered international condemnation. </p>

						<p>Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda said it was a "misconception" that India set sterilisation targets for local authorities in an effort to control the growth of its billion-plus population. "It is a target-free, promotional and a demand-driven programme," a government statement quoting Nadda as saying late Thursday (Nov 13).</p>

						<p>Indian authorities have come under criticism from rights groups and the United Nations after a mass sterilisation camp in central Chhattisgarh state led to the deaths of 12 women. Another woman died after a second session, held on Monday. Dozens more are still in hospital after Saturday's camp, when a single surgeon operated on 83 women in just five hours - spending an average of less than four minutes on each patient.</p>

						<p>The doctor, who was detained on Wednesday, has accused the government of making him a scapegoat for the controversial sterilisation scheme, which pays impoverished women 1,400 rupees (US$23) to go under the knife.</p>

						<p>Human Rights Watch has said health workers in India are coercing women into getting sterilised, under pressure to meet informal targets. Although India scrapped national sterilisation targets in 1996, the advocacy group said local health workers were still given quotas for the procedure and their jobs were on the line if they failed to meet them.</p>

						<p>The United Nations has called for all those responsible for the deaths to be held accountable and said that contraceptive choices should be made "without any forms of incentives". "Any laws, procedures or protocols that might have allowed or contributed to the deaths and other human rights violations should be reformed or changed to prevent recurrences," it said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
						
						<h4>DRUGS SEIZED</h4>

						<p>Chhattisgarh's chief minister has sacked the surgeon who conducted the operations and the chief medical officer who supervised them. The state has launched a judicial enquiry, and is also testing the drugs that the women were given after the surgery.</p>

						<p>"The seized drugs have been sent for examination," Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said. "If there is anything wrong with the drugs, we will act against the companies, manufacturer, purchaser and the medical team," he added. The state government has banned five drugs used at the camp pending investigations, including an anaesthetic and a pain killer.</p>

						<p>The victims had suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure on Monday after undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation, a process in which the fallopian tubes are tied. Although no cause of death has officially been given, authorities speculated that the women had died of septic shock. However, R K Gupta, the surgeon who performed the sterilisations, has blamed the drugs.</p>

						<p>The operations were carried out at a decommissioned hospital on the outskirts of Bilaspur. The actual operating theatre was sealed off on Friday, guarded by about six police officers.</p>

						<p>Sterilisation is one of the most popular methods of family planning in India, and many state governments organise mass camps where mainly poor, rural women can undergo the usually straightforward procedure. In all, 336 people have died as a result of sterilisations in India in the three years since 2010, according to national government figures.</p>

						<p>RAIPUR: Indian police announced on Thursday (Nov 13) they had detained the doctor behind botched mass sterilisation surgeries that left 13 women dead, as campaigners called for urgent reform of the government's family planning programme.</p><p>R.K Gupta was seized for questioning amid mounting anger over the tragedy in central Chhattisgarh state where women were paid to undergo a procedure that also left dozens in hospital, senior police officers said. The doctor carried out 83 operations in just five hours on the impoverished women, who were paid Rp 1,400 (US$23) at a state-run camp in Bilaspur district at the weekend.</p><p>"He has been taken into custody. He will be produced in the court in the afternoon today. He is likely to be arrested soon after," police inspector general Pawan Deo said from Bilaspur. Police were planning to seize equipment used during the operations, Deo said, amid fears that it was contaminated before the operations were carried out.</p><p>Gupta said he was under pressure from the state government to perform the operations, while also blaming the drugs used. "It was not my fault - the administration pressured me to meet targets," the doctor was quoted by NDTV as saying as he was being detained on Wednesday night. "The surgeries went well but the problem was with the medicines given to the women," he also alleged.<br></p><p>The state government has banned the sale of six drugs used during the operations over concerns they were substandard, the Press Trust of India news agency said.<br></p><p>Sterilisation is one of the most popular methods of family planning in India, and many state governments organise mass camps where rural women can undergo the usually straightforward procedure. Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised, often in inadequate medical facilities.<br></p><p><strong>VOMITING AFTER SURGERY</strong><br></p><p>The victims had suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure on Monday after undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation, a process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked. Some 14 women remain in hospital in a serious condition.<br></p><p>Sixteen-year-old Neelu Bai said her mother Meera died after opting to have the surgery 10 months after giving birth to her fourth child. "She started vomiting after she came back home. The doctor said she was vomiting because it was hot. He asked her to take another medicine (to stop the vomiting)," the teenager told NDTV.<br></p><p>The government has suspended four health officials and ordered an investigation into the tragedy, while angry protesters took to the streets in the state capital Raipur on Wednesday demanding the chief minister's resignation. Gupta was rounded up in Baloda Bazar district, close to where the camp was held, police inspector general Gurjinder Pal Singh told AFP.<br></p><p>Human Rights Watch said India has a long history of sterilisation-related deaths, in part because health workers were under pressure to meet "informal" monthly targets. Health workers faced salary cuts or dismissal in at least one Indian state if they failed to meet their quotas, HRW senior researcher Aruna Kashyap said on the group's website.<br></p><p>"Access to information, informed consent, and quality of services are often sacrificed by this target-driven approach," Kashyap said, calling for an overhaul of the programme. "Women may not find out about the range of contraceptive methods available or the irreversibility or potential medical complications of sterilisation."<br></p><p>Family planning programmes unfairly target women whose rights were often ignored, another group, the National Alliance for People's Movement, said. "(The tragedy) is yet another instance of serious violations of medical guidelines and brutal repression of reproductive rights and health of women in India," the Mumbai-based rights group said in a statement.<br></p><p>India's programmes have traditionally focused on women, and experts say that male sterilisation is still not accepted socially.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>RAIPUR, India: Furious protesters took to the streets in central India on Wednesday (Nov 12), smashing up cars and demanding the chief minister resign, as the death toll from a mass government-run sterilisation programme rose to 13. Another 14 women are seriously ill in Chhattisgarh state after the surgery.<br></p><p>Women are paid 1,400 rupees (US$23) to undergo the surgery under a government scheme to reduce population growth.<br></p><p>"Preliminary examinations suggest septic shock may have caused the deaths," said local government official Amar Thakur. "It looks like the equipment that was used was probably infected. We are waiting for the report," he told AFP by telephone from Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur district, where around 80 women had the surgery over the weekend.</p><p>The victims had suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure after undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation, a process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked. As the death toll rose to 13 on Wednesday, a local official said women who attended a second sterilisation camp in the area on Monday had also fallen ill.</p><p>"Six women from Gorella camp developed complications and they have been brought to Bilaspur for treatment," district commissioner Sonmani Borah told AFP.</p><p>Shops and businesses shut their doors in the state capital Raipur on Wednesday as scores of demonstrators took to the streets to demand the resignation of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh. Television footage showed the protestors, many of them opposition party workers, chanting slogans and smashing up vehicles.</p><p><strong>'ABYSMAL' CARE</strong><br></p><p>Sterilisation is one of the most popular methods of family planning in India, and many state governments organise mass camps where rural women can undergo the usually straightforward procedure.</p><p>Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised, often in inadequate medical facilities. Under pressure to meet targets, some local governments offer additional incentives such as cars and electrical goods.</p><p>In the latest case, one doctor reportedly operated on 83 women in just five hours, using the same instruments on all of them. Some of the women also said they had been forced to attend the camps, according to local media.</p><p>Sona Sharma, joint director at advocacy group the Population Foundation of India, said the quality of care provided to women undergoing sterilisation is "abysmal". "It is about time we woke up to this problem. The quality of care to women can't be compromised at any cost," she told AFP.</p><p>"The government has laid out standard protocols, but they exist only on paper," she said, urging the government to adopt a "more choice-based voluntary system" of family planning. Last year, authorities in eastern India came under fire after a news channel unearthed footage showing scores of women dumped unconscious in a field following a mass sterilisation.</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ordered an investigation into the latest deaths, and Chief Minister Singh on Tuesday suspended four top health officials. A police complaint has also been lodged against the surgeon who performed the operations. Reports said the doctor had been given a government award earlier this year for performing tens of thousands of such sterilisations.</p>

						<p>RAIPUR: Eight women have died in India and dozens more are in a critical condition after a state-run sterilisation programme designed to control the country's billion-plus population went badly wrong. More than 60 women are in hospital after suffering complications from the surgery over the weekend and 24 of them are seriously ill, authorities in the central state of Chhattisgarh said on Tuesday (Nov 11).</p><p>"Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery," said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district where the camp was held. "Since Monday, eight women have died and 64 are in various hospitals," he told AFP by telephone.</p><p>The government would investigate what went wrong, he added, as angry residents took to the streets of Bilaspur on Tuesday to demand immediate action against the doctors.</p><p>State governments in India frequently organise mass sterilisation camps under a national programme whereby women are given 1,400 rupees (US$23) as an incentive to undergo the procedure.</p><p>Under pressure to meet targets, some local governments also offer other incentives such as cars and electrical goods to couples volunteering for sterilisation. Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised, often in inadequate medical facilities.</p><p>Last year, authorities in eastern India came under fire after a news channel unearthed footage showing scores of women dumped unconscious in a field following a mass sterilisation. The women had all undergone the procedure at a hospital that local officials said was not equipped to accommodate such a large number of patients.</p><p>The Indian Express daily said the surgeries in Chhattisgarh were carried out by one doctor and his assistant in around five hours. "There was no negligence. He is a senior doctor. We will probe (the incident)," the chief medical officer of Bilaspur R K Bhange told the newspaper.</p><p>The medical superintendent of the main hospital in Bilaspur where many women were admitted said it was difficult to say what could have caused the deaths. "It would be premature to speculate on the reasons for this tragedy. We are giving priority to treating the woman admitted here as their blood pressure has gone down," Ramnesh Murthy told reporters late Monday. "We will know the reasons only once the post-mortem is completed."</p><p>A 2012 report by Human Rights Watch urged the government to set up an independent grievance redress system to allow people to report coercion and poor quality services at sterilisation centres. It also said the government should prioritise training for male government workers to provide men with information and counselling about contraceptive choices, but despite the recommendations to the national government, problems persist on the ground.</p><p>India's family planning programme has traditionally focused on women, and experts say that male sterilisation is still not accepted socially. Government figures from 2008 show that around one third of the 54 per cent of the population that reported using any form of family planning opted for female sterilisation.</p>

						<p>SINGAPORE: The threat of terrorism can cause doubts and sow division between communities - but Singapore has avoided this danger because its people are rational and have looked at the facts squarely and forthrightly condemned extremists, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. This has allowed trust to be maintained in the country, he said on Saturday (Nov 29).</p>

						<p>Mr Lee said he is particularly grateful to the Malay-Muslim community, especially its leaders, who have maintained this position.</p>

						<p>"This threat of terrorism can sow doubts and dissension amongst our communities," said Mr Lee. "And we have avoided this danger because our people are rational, because they have looked at facts squarely and they forthrightly condemned the extremists.</p>

						<p>"And so we maintained the trust amongst ourselves. I'm particularly grateful to the Malay-Muslim community who have maintained this position and especially the leaders."</p>

						<p>He also noted that the Mufti and the Religious Rehabilitation Group have done a lot to counter the ideological propaganda of Islamic State (IS). This includes producing a brochure titled "The Fallacies of ISIS Islamic Caliphate" in English, Malay and Tamil, as well as two online videos to point out these fallacies and why the brutal methods employed by ISIS are against the teachings of Islam.</p>

						<p>Mr Lee was speaking at a dialogue with religious and community leaders on Saturday, on Singapore's participation in the multinational coalition against IS. He noted that such dialogues have been held from time to time since the Sep 11 attacks, 13 years ago.</p>

						<h4>EXTREMIST TERRORISM A DIFFICULT, LONG-TERM PROBLEM</h4>

						<p>Mr Lee stressed that extremist terrorism is a serious and difficult long-term problem, especially for Singapore's multi-racial and multi-religious society.</p>

						<p>The last such dialogue was held in 2011. Mr Lee noted that Jemaah Islamiyah had been reviving its network in the region at that time. He said that, since then, Osama Bin Laden has been killed and successful counter-terrorism operations in the region have neutralised some groups, but terrorism remains a problem and the threat has worsened recently.</p>

						<p>"You must know that eradicating terrorism is going to be a difficult and long-term fight," said Mr Lee. "We have to carry on doing it and provided we continue to work together, and we are open to each other, and we share and we come closer together, we will prevail."</p>

						<p>Mr Lee said that terrorist elements in Southeast Asia are regrouping and getting more active, as the conflict in Syria and Iraq morphs into a civil war. He added that IS has also emerged, claiming to be fighting to establish a Islamic caliphate. There are also links between Southeast Asian groups and IS. People from Southeast Asia and around the world, including a few from Singapore, are also travelling to Iraq and Syria, to join IS.</p>

						<h4>IS CONFLICT AFFECTS SINGAPORE</h4>

						<p>Mr Lee stressed that although Syria and Iraq may seem faraway, the conflict and activities of IS affect Singapore. "It is naive for us to think that we can keep our heads low, and the problems will pass over us," said Mr Lee. "We have got to do what is necessary in order to protect Singapore and Singaporeans." He said this includes getting the support of the community, being vigilant domestically, and taking swift action to neutralise threats in Singapore.</p>

						<p>Singapore will also join over 60 countries, including many Muslim countries, in the coalition fight against IS. It will contribute liaison and planning officers, a KC-135R tanker aircraft for air-to-air refuelling and an Imagery Analysis Team.</p>

						<p>Mr Lee said he is also glad that community groups, Malay-Muslim organisations and other religious organisations, like the Singapore Buddhist Lodge, Taoist Federation of Singapore and the Bright Hill Temple have contributed towards humanitarian efforts to help Syrian refugees.</p>

						<h4>"IS A DEVIANT GROUP": MINISTER YAACOB</h4>

						<p>Also present at the event was Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, who said his greatest fear is that joining groups like the Islamic State becomes fashionable. He said the most important thing is to ensure the group is not normalised in the minds of Muslims in the region.</p>

						<p>"My greatest fear is that this becomes normalised; that it is ok to support them because they are fighting a tyrant like Bashar Al-Assad," said Dr Yaacob. "But then not recognising that this is not just about fighting Bashar, but basically it's a long-term agenda to dominate the whole world. I think we need to continue to drum the message that (the Islamic State) is deviant group; this is basically not Islam."</p>

						<p>Dr Yaacob also called for a regional voice to condemn IS. He stressed that at the people-to-people level, regional harmony needs to continue to be strengthened - essentially, to combat the threat posed by the terrorist group.</p>

						<p>"There has been a global voice, but I think it's good to have a regional voice also because it is going to affect the region, with over 300 fighters coming back, people have expressed concern," he said. "We are concerned, the Indonesians are concerned, the Malaysians are concerned."</p>

						<p>Dr Yaacob also noted concerns over whether the young appreciate the threat IS poses to Singapore and society over the long term. He said various platforms are needed to reach out to them, in ways that appeal to the younger generation.</p>

						<p>NAY PYI TAW: Non-traditional security problems like the Islamic State (ISIS) and the Ebola virus outbreak are on the rise, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at the East Asia Summit on Thursday (Nov 13).</p><p>On the threat posed by the ISIS, Mr Lee said there are no purely military solutions, given the complex situation in Iraq and Syria. But it is necessary to fight, contain and weaken the group, and the extremist group's ideological roots must be tackled, he said.</p><p>To this end, Singapore has proposed to conduct an East Asia Summit Symposium on de-radicalisation, providing a platform for experts to share best practices on this subject. The Republic has experience in this – it has dealt with detainees who had planned terror attacks in Singapore.</p><p>"When you fight against terrorism, it's not just fighting the physical arm battle. It's also the ideology, it's also the wrong thinking, it's also making sure that the radicals don't control the agenda and define the narrative and you're able to counter them and bring back to the true path those who have gone wrong," said Mr Lee.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Lee said Singapore strongly condemns ISIS' actions and welcomes the formation of a broad international coalition to combat the threat. For fast-breaking crises like ISIS and the Ebola virus, firm leadership by the United States is required, and Singapore is ready to support where it can, he added.</p><p>Regional leaders also need to focus on strengthening economic integration and maintaining peace and stability, Mr Lee said, as he called for more structured processes to implement agreed areas of cooperation.</p><p><strong>KEEPING GLOBAL MARKETS OPEN</strong></p><p>Turning to the global economy, Mr Lee called on world leaders, including Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and United States President Barack Obama, to keep markets open and protectionism at bay.</p><p>He added it is important to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact, which will cover almost half of the world's population and over a third of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The pact is designed to be open and inclusive,&nbsp; offering greater benefits as more economic partners join up.</p><p>"Regional economic integration is not something which you must do today, or else. It is a long-term thing," he said. "It is important. If you don't do it gradually over time, you lose relevance, you lose competitiveness, and yet it won't happen overnight."</p><p>On regional politics, Mr Lee said the relationship between the United States and China is the key to stability. He welcomed positive and regular discussions between the two major powers, as well as the resumption of talks among China, Japan and South Korea.</p><p>There have been signs of a thaw in relations, after a period of friction over historical issues and territorial disputes among the three Northeast Asian neighbours. Mr Lee said how regional hotspots are managed will reflect on the leaders' commitment to development and regional cooperation.</p><p>On the sidelines of the various summits in Nay Pyi Taw, Mr Lee met New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. Both leaders reaffirmed long-standing bilateral ties and discussed regional economic and security issues.</p><p>Capping a week-long stretch of back-to-back meetings, Mr Lee's next stop is in Brisbane, Australia for the G20 Summit,&nbsp;which starts on Saturday (Nov 15). He said countries there will discuss how to promote world growth, and suggested that one way is to talk about investments in infrastructure, to give developing economies - and even some developed ones - a leg up.</p>

						<p>SINGAPORE: The Republic will join 33 other nations in a multinational coalition to combat the Islamic State militant group, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in Parliament on Monday (Nov 3). Joining in the ongoing international efforts "contributes directly to Singapore's own security", added Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister Teo Chee Hean.</p><p>The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has previously participated in multinational coalition efforts against religious extremists who pose a terrorist threat to Singapore and Singaporeans – as it did in Afghanistan against Al Qaeda and the Taliban – and it will continue to participate in such efforts, Dr Ng said.</p><p>In response to a question from MP Alex Yam on how SAF will contribute to the coalition, Dr Ng said SAF’s contribution will be "within its means" and "sustainable and useful". This includes sending liaison and planning officers to the United States Central Command and the Combined Joint Task Force HQ, a KC-135R tanker aircraft for air-to-air refuelling, and an Imagery Analysis Team – assets that were previously&nbsp;deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>These contributions have proved effective and were appreciated by international partners, he added.</p><p>There will be no SAF troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria; they will instead operate out of neighbouring countries, Dr Ng said.</p><p>"There will be risks to our SAF servicemen as they carry out their missions. To mitigate these risks, we will ensure that our servicemen are well equipped, and receive additional training in weapon handling, dealing with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), as well as reacting to hostile elements," Dr Ng said.</p><p><strong>"SINGAPORE NEEDS TO PLAY ITS PART"</strong></p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Teo said in a separate statement on Monday that Singapore is not immune to the Islamic State threat.</p><p>“The threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria affects all of us, in all&nbsp;countries," said Mr Teo, adding that Singapore "needs to play its part and support international efforts to contain the threat posed by ISIS" as it "contributes directly to our own security".<br></p><p>Mr Teo also said Singapore has taken actions to strengthen community bonds and to counter extremist ideology to help prevent Singaporeans from becoming radicalised. He said it is "heartening" to see how all communities have worked with or supported one another on this front.<br></p><p>"Our Malay-Muslim community in particular has taken a firm stance against the violent actions of ISIS, and taken proactive steps to counter their extremist ideology, and to help all&nbsp;those who are suffering from violence in the Middle East,” he added.</p><p><strong>ISIS POSES A THREAT TO ALL SINGAPOREANS</strong></p><p>Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, also reiterated the Malay-Muslim community's stance against ISIS.</p><p>"MUIS (Islamic Religious Council of Singapore), Malay/Muslim organisations, community leaders and the Government have worked very hard together for many years to combat radical teachings that abuse the name of Islam," said Dr Yaacob, the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.<br></p><p>"I strongly urge all communities to continue to work together so that our people are more informed, understand each other better, and are not easily swayed by inaccurate or provocative foreign or social media reporting. This way, we will emerge stronger as Singaporeans, united in our common goal for peace, understanding and harmony."</p><p>"The terrorist activities by ISIS pose a threat to all Singaporeans, regardless of race or religion," he added. "Our decision to be part of the multi-national coalition against ISIS is primarily to protect Singapore and Singaporeans. Although based far away in foreign countries, we know that terrorist groups can pose a direct security threat to us through their efforts to export terrorism to this region. We cannot be complacent."</p><p>Dr Yaacob also said that the move against ISIS cannot be "interpreted as an act against Islam".<br></p><p>"I know some of us may think that Islam and Muslims have been put in the spotlight again," said Dr Yaacob. "But this move against ISIS cannot be interpreted as an act against Islam, or Muslims, because ISIS is not Islamic."<br></p><p>"Mufti, Pergas and RRG (The Religious and Rehabilitation Group) have joined international Muslim scholars and leaders in condemning ISIS unequivocally," he added. "They have all declared that ISIS’ radical teachings and actions have nothing to do with Islam. Islam upholds peace, the preservation of human life and its sanctity, and it is thus forbidden in Islam to wage war wantonly on others."</p>

						<p>MILAN:&nbsp;Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore is "seriously considering" how it can be a helpful partner in the fight against militant group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).<br></p><p>Speaking at a retreat at the 10th Asia-Europe Meeting in Milan, Italy, on Friday (Oct 17), Mr Lee told political leaders from the two regions that Singapore welcomes the formation of a broad international coalition, including the US and many Muslim countries, to combat the terrorist threat.&nbsp;<br><br>"Our priority is fight against terrorism and in particular to protect our people and our society and we are concerned that ISIS or other extremist groups like ISIS can be the seed which can infect some of our people and mislead them and cause them to have strange and dangerous ideas.<br></p><p>"So this is a continuing threat to us, we are managing it quite well, but there is a broad international coalition which is fighting ISIS and it includes Muslim countries, it includes developed countries, the United States is playing a major role," said Mr Lee. "So I think we should consider how we can be helpful to them, it is something we are studying actively now."<br><br>The Prime Minister said that given the complex situation in Iraq and Syria,&nbsp;there is no purely military solution to this problem. But it is still necessary to contain and weaken ISIS, he said.</p><p>In recent weeks, a US-led coalition has carried out <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/kobane-continues-to/1420104.html" target="_blank">air strikes against ISIS targets in Kobane</a>, a Syrian town at the border of Turkey, to push back the advance of the militants.<br></p><p>Singapore strongly condemns the terrorist actions of ISIS and takes the threat of the group seriously as there is a direct implication on the country's security and social cohesion, Mr Lee said.&nbsp;He told ASEM members that a number of people from the region have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS, including Singaporeans. "A couple of Singaporeans have gone fighting for ISIS. We have picked up others who have self-radicalised," Mr Lee said.&nbsp;</p><p>But he said that Singaporean Muslims at large actively support religious and racial harmony, with Muslim religious and community leaders in Singapore "unequivocally" condemning the acts of ISIS.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Singapore Mufti has reminded Muslims not to be influenced by those who arbitrary call for jihad in the name of Islam, while the Religious Rehabilitation Group - formed a decade ago after the discovery of Al-Qaeda linked group in Singapore - "has <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/religious-rehabilitation/1320536.html" target="_blank">raised awareness of the dangers of the Syrian conflict</a> and debunked misconceptions that fighting in Syria is a form of jihad", Mr Lee said.</p><p>Singapore also co-sponsored the recent United Nations Security Council resolution 2178, which requires all nations to adopt laws that would make it a serious crime for their nationals to join extremist groups such as ISIS.<br></p><p>Mr Lee said such extremist groups are a threat as they can recruit vulnerable individuals with their extremist ideology. "Battle-hardened and radicalised returnees can return to Singapore and carry out attacks on home soil, or collaborate with terrorist groups in our region, like the Jemaah Islamiyah network and its reincarnations," he said. "The risk is not just direct casualties from a terrorist attack, but also long-term damage to racial and religious harmony."&nbsp;</p>

						<p>TOKYO: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling party showed a strong lead in opinion polls released Monday (Nov 24) ahead of Japan's general election next month, despite a majority of respondents giving a thumbs down to his economic blitz.</p>

						<p>Japan's lower parliamentary chamber was dissolved on Friday ahead of the election that Abe says will be a referendum on his faltering economic policies, dubbed "Abenomics".</p>

						<p>Thirty-five percent of those polled said they would vote for Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its candidates in the December 14 lower house election, while just nine percent supported the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).</p>

						<p>A large number of votes were still up for grabs, with the poll - jointly carried out by the Nikkei Business Daily and TV Tokyo over the weekend - showing 45 percent of the 1,031 households surveyed as undecided.</p>

						<p>But a majority of respondents disapproved of the prime minister's bid to stimulate growth in Japan's lagging economy, with 51 percent opposing his approach and just 33 percent endorsing it.</p>

						<p>Abe, who is going to the polls less than halfway through a four-year term, earlier said he wanted voters' endorsement for his decision to postpone a sales tax rise slated for next year, after data last week showed an earlier levy hike knocked the world's number three economy into recession.</p>

						<p>Only 16 percent of those surveyed said they had felt the positive impact of an economic recovery over the past two years, with an overwhelming 75 percent saying they had not.</p>

						<p>Forty-four percent said they expect "Abenomics" to spur a recovery or wage hikes, while 49 percent say they have no such hopes, according to the survey.</p>

						<p>A separate weekend opinion poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper showed 37 percent of respondents plan to vote for the ruling LDP in the upcoming election, against 11 percent in favour of the opposition DPJ.</p>

						<p>Abe runs the risk of undermining his authority if his coalition's majority is reduced too much in the election.</p>

						<p>Some commentators say that the vote is a fig leaf to cover the prime minister's attempt to consolidate his own position within his fractious LDP, and to fend off challengers in a party leadership election scheduled for September next year.</p>

						<p>TOKYO: Japan's lower parliamentary chamber was dissolved on Friday (Nov 21) ahead of a mid-December general election that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says will be a referendum on his faltering "Abenomics" economic growth blitz.</p><p>Following the dissolution, the premier's cabinet confirmed the election will be held on Sunday, December 14, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, Tokyo's top spokesman. Later, Abe told reporters at his office that the vote will be "an election to ask if we should push for Abenomics or stop it".</p><p>Abe, who is going to the polls less than half way through a four-year term, earlier said he wanted voters' endorsement for his decision to postpone a sales tax rise slated for next year, after data this week showed an earlier levy hike knocked the world's number three economy into recession.</p><p>"Finally, the fight will begin," Abe told fellow politicians on Friday who cheered in response to the remarks in parliament. "Let's fulfill our responsiblity to make Japan a country that once again shines at the centre of the world. "I promise to take the lead so that all of you here will be elected. Let's grab a win together."</p><p>On Thursday, Abe acknowledged he could be facing a "tough election". "I want to clarify if the growth strategy we are pushing is right or wrong," he told a business audience in Tokyo.<br></p><p>But most commentators agree that the election is a fig leaf to cover Abe's attempt to consolidate his own position within his fractious Liberal Democratic Party, and to fend off challengers in a party leadership election scheduled for September next year. Abe runs the risk of undermining his authority if his coalition's majority is reduced too much.</p><p><strong>WAITING FOR REFORMS</strong><br></p><p>The last 24 months have seen two of the so-called "three arrows" of the premier's policy blitz fired - massive fiscal stimulus and a flood of easy money. A third "arrow" of structural reforms has inched along in the face of resistance from the vested interests that it is intended to undermine, including a politically powerful farm lobby.</p><p>"The third arrow has never flown at all because it faces resistance" even from Abe's own conservative LDP, Kenji Eda, co-leader of the opposition Japan Restoration Party, said on Thursday.</p><p>While many economists say that it's crucial to press on with reforms, critics worry that Abe's growth blueprint will leave Japan saddled with more debt - it already has one of the worst debt burdens among rich nations.</p><p>"We can't have the (rich-poor) gap widen," said Banri Kaieda, head of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan. "We can't give him a blank cheque for another four years."</p><p>According to opinion polls conducted by the Asahi newspaper this week, the Abe cabinet's approval rate fell to 39 percent from 42 percent earlier this month. Its disapproval rate rose to 40 percent from 36 percent, pushing it above his approval rate for the first time since he took office in December 2012, the survey showed.</p><p>The sales tax delay will put off a rise to 10 percent, after the first increase to 8.0 percent from 5.0 percent on April 1 sent consumers scurrying for cover and took a huge bite out of the economy.</p><p>Originally scheduled for next October, Abe said the fresh hike would now not take place until at least early 2017. But the Asahi survey said 65 percent of voters were not convinced by his reasoning to call a snap election.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new mandate would bolster the premier's case for pushing ahead with the re-starting of nuclear reactors - an unpopular idea in a nation scarred by the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the worst atomic crisis in a generation. It would also strengthen Abe's hand on pet issues such reforming Japan's view of its 20th century military aggression, which he and other nationalists say is masochistic.</p>

						<p>TOKYO: The lower chamber of Japan's parliament was dissolved on Friday (Nov 21) in readiness for a general election, which will be held on Dec 14, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeks to consolidate his grip on power and reinvigorate his economic drive.</p><p>"In accordance with article seven of Japan's constitution, the lower house is dissolved," speaker Bunmei Ibuki told the chamber.

Abe's cabinet on Friday officially set the vote for Dec 14, NHK public TV said.</p><p>&nbsp;Abe said earlier this week that he wanted to ask for voters' endorsement for his decision to postpone a sales tax rise after data showed an earlier hike had knocked the economy off its axis.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm fully aware that it's going to be a tough election," Abe told a meeting of businessmen Thursday afternoon in Tokyo.

						<p>TOKYO: Japan's government on Wednesday (Nov 19) hit back against charges of profligacy over the US$500 million cost of a general election that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called, more than two years ahead of schedule.</p><p>Abe said on Tuesday he was putting off an expected sales tax rise and calling a snap poll, to seek approval for the delay, insisting the issue of revenue-raising "is important in a parliamentary democracy". "Because we made a very important decision concerning people's everyday lives and the economy, I decided that I should seek a fresh mandate," Abe told a televised press conference. "No taxation without representation," Abe said, echoing the slogan of the American War of Independence from Britain.</p><p>But critics jumped on the wastefulness of a nationwide vote less than two years into a four-year term, with many pointing to Japan's mountainous national debt and its still-ruined coastline, more than three years after a massive tsunami hit.</p><p>The government "should launch economic policies, rather than spending ¥60 billion (US$512 million) on the election," Keiichiro Asao, head of the minor opposition Your Party, said ahead of the announcement. Takuya Tasso, governor of Iwate prefecture, one of the regions hit hardest by the 2011 tsunami that also sparked the Fukushima nuclear crisis, said the central government had its priorities wrong. "Creating a political vacuum at a time when we are still in need of economic stimulus should never happen," he told the mass-selling Yomuiri Shimbun.</p><p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that Abe was within his rights to go to the polls early. Dissolving the lower house and calling a snap election "is written in our constitution, and I think it's natural for a prime minister to ask his voters" for their opinion.</p><p>The tax hike Abe delayed was the second part of an increase in VAT, which was written into law under the last government, with the support of parliament. His decision came after figures showed Japan had slid into recession, largely because consumers took fright after the first rise in April, reining in their spending.</p><p>But commentators have pointed out that the legislation contained provision for the serving prime minister to suspend the rise if he judged the economy was not in good enough shape, and said Abe needs no extra authority from voters.</p><p>Most agree that the election is a fig leaf to cover Abe's attempt to consolidate his own position within his fractious Liberal Democratic Party, and to fend off challengers in a party leadership election scheduled for September next year. However, he also runs the risk of undermining his authority if his coalition's majority is reduced too much.</p>

						</figure>
						<p>KOH SAMUI: With its stunning limestone cliffs towering over stilt houses surrounded by azure waters, the island of Panyee is a typical Thai paradise. But it is not mother nature drawing tourists here - it is a floating football pitch.</p>

						<p>Thailand's tourism industry has taken a battering this year following months of protests, the May military coup, the subsequent imposition of martial law and the brutal slaying of two young Britons on the holiday isle of Koh Tao in September.</p>

						<p>The Immigration Bureau said there has been a near 9 per cent drop in tourist arrivals between January and October compared to the same period in 2013 - a painful blow for the millions of Thais whose livelihoods depend on the industry.</p>

						<p>But in Panyee, part of Thailand's picturesque Phanga Nga province, foreign visitors keep coming thanks to excitement over the community's innovative and highly unusual football pitch.</p>

						<p>Nestled next to the largely Muslim island's ferry pier, the 16 by 25 metre pitch has become something of a national treasure after an advertising campaign by a Thai bank in 2010 made the fishing community locally famous for their dedication to football.</p>

						<p>"What do you do when you come to Panyee Island? You must see the floating football pitch," beams island chief Muhammad Prasanpan, who said 50,000-70,000 baht (US$1,500-2,100) now comes in from tourists each day. That represents a five-fold income increase for the 320 household-island since a decade ago when fishing was its mainstay, the chief said.</p>

						<p>The island has long had a reputation for football-obsessed inhabitants who have refused to let something as inconvenient as a complete lack of flat surfaces hold them back from practising the "Beautiful Game".</p>
						
						<h4>DANGEROUS NAILS</h4>

						<p>Originally islanders played on a beach, but could only do so during low tide when enough sand was visible. The first floating pitch was built 30-years ago but was a dangerous hotchpotch of wooden boards knocked together with rusty nails. "We had to avoid nails coming up. It was risky and dangerous. But we had to play on it because we had no pitch," recalled boat driver Prakit Prasanpan, sporting the local team's shirt.</p>

						<p>Inspired by their dedication, TMB Bank commissioned a series of adverts charting the local team's success in a football tournament despite the rickety pitch. After the campaign aired the islanders, with help from local authorities, built themselves a new - and crucially nail-free - floating pitch.</p>

						<p>Since those adverts aired in 2011, Panyee has become famous both locally - and increasingly internationally - for football. But the pitch has done more than attract new arrivals. It has kept the island's younger inhabitants from leaving.</p>

						<p>Depopulation is often a major problem in Thailand's poor communities, with youngsters travelling significant distances to find better paid work - usually to support large families back home. In Panyee, the young are staying put. The island's population has increased to 1,800 from 1,200 over the last 10 years.</p>

						<p>"Jobs here are better than on the mainland - the young can find money more easily here, they can earn thousands of baht driving canoes," explained 74-year-old Aporn Janchulee, a market stall holder.</p>

						<h4>TOURISM SUFFERING ELSEWHERE</h4>

						<p>But other tourist hotspots are not so fortunate. Between January and October tourism income in Thailand fell 6.1 per cent compared to the same period last year to 905 million baht (US$27.5 billion).</p>

						<p>With so many reliant on tourism in a country that dubs itself the "Land of Smiles", Thailand's generals know they must restore confidence. The junta have vowed to "Return beaches to the people" - a side project of their wider promise to "Return happiness to Thailand". The first clean-up campaign was launched in the large resort island of Phuket where the authorities took down unregistered umbrella and food stalls. But while the campaign restored a more pristine look to some of Phuket's beaches, it angered many local businesses.</p>

						<p>Meanwhile the junta's attempts to bolster tourism were dealt a blow by the September murder of David Miller, 24, and the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge, 23, on Koh Tao. The authorities have charged two Myanmar nationals with killing the British pair but they later retracted their confessions, alleging they were obtained under duress.</p>

						<p>Thailand's junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha also caused widespread dismay after the murders when he suggested that attractive foreign women could not expect to be safe from attack if they walked around in bikinis. He later made a rare apology for his remarks.</p>

						<p>Back in Panyee, the locals hope Thailand's tourist troubles do not put off visitors - and that the floating pitch will continue to draw curious football fans - if they are to provide for future generations.</p>

						<p>As village chief Muhammad concluded: "I think we should keep the football pitch for our children and grandchildren because we can say that the floating pitch is unique to the village."</p>

						<p>This phase applies to instructors engaged for school-based co-curricular and enrichment activities, both academic and non-academic, that are more than eight hours and fewer than 20 hours per contract or, for example, one month of weekly three-hour sessions, the press release stated.</p>

						<p>This announcement came after the first phase of registration was announced in March this year, and encompassed the following:</p>

						<p>
							<li>Co-curricular Activities (CCA) coaches and instructors</li>
							<li>Art and Music Scheme (AMIS) instructors</li>
							<li>Programme for Active Learning (PAL) instructors</li>
							<li>Conversational Chinese/Malay instructors</li>
							<li>Instructors for activities that involve overnight stay or overseas trips with students</li>
							<li>All other instructors of school-based co-curricular and enrichment activities with duration of 20 hours or more per contract (for example, one term of weekly two-hour sessions)</li>
						</p>

						<p>MOE said all Government, Government-aided, independent, specialised independent and specialised schools will only engage instructors from the first phase who are registered from January 2015.</p>

						<p>As for instructors who are registering in the second phase, schools may still engage their services in 2015 even if they are not registered, but only if their contracts do not extend to 2016, the ministry clarified.</p>

						<p>These instructors may apply to register with MOE, and are encouraged to do so in the first half of 2015. All applicants will be notified by email on the outcome about six to eight weeks upon the ministry receiving the completed notification.</p>

						<p>SINGAPORE: A former Singapore Customs investigation officer was on Thursday (Nov 13) charged for corruptly attempting to obtain gratification in return for showing leniency for an offence of possessing contraband cigarettes.</p>

						<p>According to the charge, Jonathan Sasayiah, 28, attempted to obtain gratification in the form of intimate acts from Ms Nursusilla Kassim on Jul 15 this year. In return, he would show leniency to her for being in possession of contraband cigarettes.</p>

						<p>"Law enforcement officers are vested with the authority to clamp down on illicit activities in Singapore. Any law enforcement officer who even attempts to abuse this authority for personal and corrupt gains will face severe consequences," the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said.</p>

						<p>CPIB added Singapore has a "zero tolerance approach" towards corruption, and will not hesitate to take action against any party involved in such acts.</p>

						<p>If convicted, the former Customs officer faces a jail term of up to five years and a fine not more than S$100,000, or both.</p>

						<p>At least 95 people have been killed and 120 injured in airstrikes by Syrian government forces on the northern city of Raqqa, a stronghold for the extremist group ISIS, a monitoring group said Wednesday.</p>

						<p>The death toll from Tuesday's airstrikes is expected to rise because many people are critically injured, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</p>

						<p>Government warplanes carried out at least 10 airstrikes in Raqqa, targeting the city's al-Hani Mosque and the public souk, or market, the Observatory said. Its reports are based on information from a network of activists and residents on the ground in Syria.</p>

						<p>Syria's state TV and news agency SANA have not reported on military operations targeting Raqqa.</p>

						<p>The U.S.-led coalition against ISIS has also carried out airstrikes in the area since the start of operations in September.</p>

						<p>The extremists have made the city, which sits on the banks of the Euphrates River, the de facto capital of their self-declared "Islamic State" that stretches across large areas of Syria and Iraq.</p>

						<p>The city is known as a place where ISIS puts training centers, weapons depots and accommodations for fighters. During the Syrian conflict, the group has also seized military bases from the Syrian regime near the city and in the wider Raqqa province.</p>

						<p>U.S. Central Command said the coalition carried out 10 airstrikes in Syria from Monday to Wednesday, hitting ISIS targets near the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani.</p>
						
						<h4>Report: ISIS commander in Iraq killed</h4>

						<p>Across the border in northern Iraq, tens of ISIS militants were killed after they attacked Mosul Dam on Wednesday from three directions, a spokesman for Kurdish Peshmerga forces at the dam told CNN.</p>

						<p>The assault ended after coalition aircraft targeted ISIS convoys, he said. Six Peshmerga fighters were injured.
						A U.S.-led coalition airstrike killed a senior ISIS figure near the city of Hit along with dozens of others riding in a convoy of vehicles Tuesday, Sabah Karkhout, the head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council, told CNN.</p>

						<p>Senan Meteeb, named by ISIS as the "emir" or "prince" of the group's military in the area in western Anbar province, was reportedly killed along with 30 other ISIS militants when the convoy was hit about 190 kilometers (118 miles) northwest of Baghdad.</p>

						<p>Meteeb was directly responsible for operations that led to the recent killing of hundreds of Albu Nimr Sunni tribesmen who fought against ISIS side-by-side with Iraqi security forces in Anbar province and Hit, Karkhout said.</p>

						<p>Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud, one of the leaders of the Albu Nimr tribe, confirmed to CNN that Meteeb was a top-ranking ISIS leader in the Hit area, but he said he had no confirmation from his men on the ground that he had been killed. If true, he said, Meteeb would be a high-value target.</p>

						<p>Hit and neighboring Ramadi were holdouts in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province after ISIS swept in from Syria, taking town after town in the western province. Albu Nimr tribesmen were among those who fought them until they began running of out weapons and supplies.</p>

						<p>U.S. Central Command said the coalition had carried out seven airstrikes in Iraq from Monday to Wednesday but listed none on a convoy in the Hit area.</p>

						<p>The closest was an airstrike northwest of Ramadi that damaged an ISIS checkpoint.</p>

						<p>Two airstrikes near Mosul destroyed an ISIS fighting position, buildings and vehicles, and also struck a large ISIS unit, Central Command said.</p>

						<p>Two more airstrikes near the northern city of Kirkuk and one in the Sinjar area, also in the north, took out ISIS vehicles, it said. Another west of Baiji destroyed an ISIS vehicle and damaged another.</p>

						<p>Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli security forces said Thursday they have broken up a wide-ranging terror plot, which would have included attacks on a football stadium, abductions and car bombings.</p>
						<p>Authorities arrested at least 30 members of Palestinian militant group Hamas and seized rifles, ammunition and explosives, said the Shin Bet, the country's security agency.</p>
						<p>The terror cells were getting orders from Hamas leaders in Turkey, while the operatives got their training outside Israel and were then smuggled back in to carry out the attacks, the Shin Bet said.</p>
						<p>The arrests were made in September after explosive devices were detonated on August 31 in the West Bank, leading to a full investigation.</p>
						<p>Among the targets selected were the Teddy football stadium and a light rail station in Jerusalem, the Shin Bet said. There were also plans to carry out attacks and abductions in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, it said.</p>
						<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Shin Bet and Israel Defense Forces "for foiling very dangerous terrorist actions that could have claimed many victims in our country."</p>
						<p>While this operation has been made public, many other counter-terror actions against Hamas remain secret, he said, while visiting the Sde Boker kibbutz in southern Israel.</p>
						<p>"We are operating day and night in order to maintain the security of Israel's citizens; the people who do this are deserving of all praise and support," he said.</p>

						<p>PARIS: Florian Thauvin scored one goal and set up another as Ligue 1 leaders Marseille beat Nantes 2-0 at the Stade Velodrome on Friday (Nov 28) evening (Nov 28).</p>

						<p>Thauvin deftly converted a Dimitri Payet cross and then saw his free-kick headed home by Rod Fanni as Marseille opened up a two-goal lead before half-time and held on to claim a seventh consecutive home victory, their best run at the Velodrome since their 2009-10 title-winning campaign.</p>

						<p>The result ensured that they will go into December on top of the table although reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain can trim their lead back to one point with a win at home to Nice on Saturday afternoon.</p>

						<p>"Nantes are a good, well disciplined side. It was tougher than usual for us but we managed to keep our run going," goalkeeper and captain Steve Mandanda told beIN Sports.</p>

						<p>"Victories breed confidence. We believe in ourselves and it would be good to finish strongly before the winter break. We are aware that the road is long and there are very good teams out there, but we remain focused, humble and will work hard to win as many matches as possible between now and the end of the season."</p>

						<p>Nantes came into the game in fourth place thanks to a fine sequence of nine matches undefeated, their best run since they last won the title in 2001.</p>

						<p>The Canaries were first to threaten when a Remi Gomis shot from 20 yards tested Mandanda in the home goal, but it was OM who opened the scoring 24 minutes in.</p>

						<p>Payet, playing against his old club, did well to dig out a cross from the right flank and Thauvin got in front of Issa Cissokho to flick the ball into the net with the outside of his boot.</p>

						<p>Marcelo Bielsa's side have made a habit of starting games well this season and that was the 11th time they had found the net in the opening half-hour of matches.</p>

						<p>Ligue 1's leading scorers have also been grateful to Mandanda for some fine goalkeeping and to luck at times though and that was the case in the 36th minute when the French international saved from Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, with the Nantes winger then unable to net the follow-up as he lost his balance.</p>

						<p>And three minutes after that Marseille doubled their lead, Fanni meeting Thauvin's right-wing free-kick at the near post and heading the ball past Remy Riou for his first Ligue 1 goal in nearly two years.</p>

						<p>Nantes won in Marseille 12 months ago, a result that led to OM coach Elie Baup being sacked, but they never really looked capable of getting back into this game in the second half, even if Mandanda was called into action again to keep out a thumping Jordan Veretout shot.</p>

						<p>Elsewhere this weekend, Monaco will look to build on their midweek Champions League win at Bayer Leverkusen when they go to in-form Rennes, while third-placed Lyon travel to face local rivals Saint-Etienne.</p>

						<p>CONAKRY: British scientists announced trials on a 15-minute Ebola test in Guinea as French President Francois Hollande arrived in Conakry on Friday (Nov 28), becoming the first Western leader to visit one of the countries devastated by the epidemic.</p>

						<p>The prototype is six times faster than current tests and aims to speed up diagnosis, the London-based global research charity Wellcome Trust and Britain's Department for International Development (DFID) said in a statement.</p>

						<p>"A reliable, 15-minute test that can confirm cases of Ebola would be a key tool for effective management of the Ebola outbreak, allowing patients to be identified, isolated and cared for as soon as possible," said Val Snewin of the Wellcome Trust. She said the test was designed to be suitable for remote field hospitals where electricity and cold storage are often scarce.</p>

						<p>The trials, to be led by researchers from Dakar's Pasteur Institute at an Ebola treatment centre in Conakry in the coming weeks, will come as a welcome boon in Guinea which has lost 1,200 people to Ebola.</p></p>

						<p>The biggest Ebola epidemic on record has claimed around 5,700 lives in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since the beginning of the year, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

						<p>President Hollande pledged his support for Guinea after arriving in France's west African former colony on Friday. He said he was bringing with him a message of solidarity to healthcare workers who "take risks to ensure the highest quality care", and a message of confidence, because "it was very important to tell the world that Guinea is still alive, still fighting". He also wanted to call for vigilance, he said, because "the battle against Ebola isn't won".</p>

						<h4>'VERY IMPORTANT SIGN'</h4>

						<p>The visit is the first by a French president since 1999, and comes after France pledged €100 million (US$125 million) towards the fight against the epidemic in Guinea. The money will help finance several care centres as well as 200 beds, some of which are reserved for health workers caring for the sick.</p>
						
						<p>France has also pledged to set up two training centres for health workers, one in France and one in Guinea. In addition, French biotechnology companies will set up rapid diagnostic tests in Africa.</p>

						<p>Hollande visited healthcare workers at Conakry's Donka hospital, which hosts the city's Doctors Without Borders Ebola treatment unit, alongside his Guinean counterpart Alpha Conde. Before entering, both men followed the protocol of washing their hands and having their temperatures taken.</p>

						<p>The French leader is also due to sign a cooperation agreement with Guinean authorities for the creation of a Pasteur Institute in Conakry by the end of 2016, the global medical research organisation said on Thursday.</p>

						<p>"For the people of Guinea, the arrival of President Hollande is a very, very important sign," Conde said. "If the president of a country as important as France can come to Guinea, that means anyone can come to Guinea."</p>

						<h4>HEIGHTENED TENSIONS</h4>

						<p>The visit comes amid heightened tensions in Guinea over the government's handling of the Ebola crisis and criticism over curbs to free speech.</p>

						<p>Conde said on Wednesday the use of force was entirely justified in battling the deadly Ebola outbreak. "There are still people who think Ebola is fiction," Conde told a news conference in a country where an eight-member Ebola education team was murdered by angry villagers in September.</p>

						<p>"We have an agenda which is to finish with Ebola as soon as possible and in Guinea this is possible," he added. "If people don't want to be treated we will use force because we won't allow the illness to spread despite all our efforts."</p>

						<p>Press advocacy organisation Reporters Without Borders has voiced concern about the attacks on press freedom under the pretext of the fight against Ebola. Meanwhile, the Guinean opposition coalition this week denounced the lack of consultation by the government over its strategy for fighting Ebola.</p>

						<p>Hollande is due to travel to the Senegalese capital Dakar later on Friday to take part in a summit of French-speaking leaders that is likely to be dominated by the Ebola crisis as well as the recent unrest in Burkina Faso. "Tomorrow at the Francophonie Summit, I will launch a new appeal for international mobilisation. But France must lead by example," he told a cheering crowd in Conakry.</p>

						<p>The Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies urged the international community to refrain from "complacency" despite signs that the epidemic is stabilising in Guinea and Liberia.</p>

						<p>"The progress made in the fight against Ebola must be regarded as confirmation that our collective approach is successful and encourage us to stay the course until the epidemic is really under control," said Elhadj As Sy, the head of the organisation.</p>

						<p>LILLE, France: Roger Federer said on Tuesday (Nov 18) he was "hopeful" he would be able to play in the Davis Cup final against France on Friday despite the crippling back injury he sustained in London.</p>

						<p>"I am not good enough to practice yet and I wish my progress would be faster," the Swiss star told a press conference at the Stade Pierre Mauroy outside Lille which will host the three-day final. "It's a little bit better than on Saturday, Sunday, Monday so I am hopeful."</p>

						<p>Federer sustained the back injury playing in the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour finals in London on Saturday evening during a gruelling three set match against Swiss teammate Stan Wawrinka. The world number two said that the Swiss team's medical staff had been working hard on his fitness and that the pain he had felt on Saturday was easing.</p>

						<p>Asked if he was worried about missing the chance to win the Davis Cup final for the first time in his career, he replied: "I don't know. I'm a positive kind of person so I have to believe in it."</p>

						<p>Were Federer to miss the final, it would be a huge body blow to Swiss hopes as although Wawrinka at fourth in the world is comfortably ranked above all the French players, after him the fall off in the Swiss team is steep with Marco Chiudinelli 212th and Michael Lammer 508th.</p>

						<p>Federer and Wawrinka earlier took to Twitter in a bid to bury any lingering resentments from their at times bad-tempered London match. "It's great being with the boys again," tweeted Federer, above a Swiss team picture including himself and Wawrinka with arms around each other. In the shot, world number four Wawrinka makes playful 'bunny ears' behind his team-mate's head.</p>

						<p>That frivolity seemed light years from the fallout that hit the two countrymen as Federer defeated Wawrinka 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (8/6) on Saturday evening in the ATP World Tour Finals semi-finals.</p>

						<p>Federer had saved three match points in the 10th game of the deciding set in that match and it was poised at 5-5 and 40-40 in game 11 when Warwinka gestured to Federer's box asking that they not make noise in between serves. Federer's wife Mirka was sitting in the players section and he was reportedly upset that Wawrinka had blamed her.</p>

						<p>The two were then seen involved in a long and tense discussion in the locker-room after the match and on Monday each went their own way en route from London to Lille in northern France for the Davis Cup showdown.</p>

						<p>The London dogfight between the Swiss, the intensity of which astonished many people in France, has cast a cloud over the Swiss hopes.</p>

						<p>In stark contrast it has been all plain sailing for the French who are seeking a 10th Davis Cup title in all and a first since 2001.</p>

						<p>Captain Arnaud Clement cloistered his team of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils, Richard Gasquet and reserve Gilles Simon, none of whom qualified for the London finals, in Bordeaux where they honed their claycourt skills away from prying eyes.</p>

						<p>The French as hosts have chosen an indoor claycourt as the surface for the final believing that gives them a better chance of defeating the two higher-ranked Swiss players.</p>

						<p>Doubles specialist Julien Benneteau, who was playing in the doubles in London, then linked up with them after they decamped to Lille.</p>

						<p>Clement said that the French camp were not even considering contesting the Davis Cup final without the presence of Federer. "We have been preparing for the last 10 days to play against a French team with Federer and Wawrinka in it," he said.</p>

						<p>Clement said that he had yet to decide who would play the opening two singles on Friday but Tsonga looks sure to be top choice with Gasquet slightly ahead of Monfils for the second slot.</p>

						<p>BRISBANE: Australia said Thursday (Nov 13) it is tracking four Russian navy ships off its north coast, a move Prime Minister Tony Abbott said was a sign of Moscow's military assertiveness with relations strained after the downing of flight MH17 in Ukraine.</p>

						<p>The appearance of the fleet coincides with Vladimir Putin's arrival at the G20 summit in Brisbane this weekend and follows a highly anticipated exchange between the Russian president and Australian premier Tony Abbott in Beijing.</p>

						<p>Putin's presence in Brisbane was questioned, given Australia's anger at the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in July, in which 298 people died in rebel-held eastern Ukraine, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.</p>

						<p>But the G20's consensus was that he should attend despite Kiev and the West claiming the plane was blown out of the sky with a missile supplied by Russia, an allegation Moscow denies.</p>

						<p>"Defence is monitoring Russian naval vessels that are currently transiting through international waters to the north of Australia," the Australian Defence Force said in a statement. Australian media reports said they include a "heavily armed" cruiser and destroyer, a tug boat and a refuelling vessel.</p>

						<p>Australia said the Russian navy has previously been deployed in conjunction with major international summits. A warship from Russia's Pacific Fleet accompanied former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev's visit to San Francisco in 2010.</p>

						<p>John Blaxland, an international security expert at the Australian National University, said having ships off Australian waters was "huff and puff" by Putin designed to reinforce his "tough, he-man image".</p>

						<p>"This is a show of force, a stage-managed event and is all for show," he told AFP. "People don't go around doing this unless they feel insecure and need to assert themselves. It's consistent with Putin's chest-out, posturing behaviour. It bolsters his domestic credentials."</p>

						<h4>RUSSIA ‘SENDING MESSAGE’</h4>

						<p>Abbott famously vowed to "shirtfront" Putin - an Australian Rules football term in which a player charges an opponent - in Brisbane over the downing of MH17. The pair met on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Beijing this week without incident.</p>

						<p>"It's not unusual for Russians to deploy in the vicinity of major conferences and let's not forget that Russia has been much more militarily assertive in recent times," Abbott said Thursday in Myanmar on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit.</p> 

						<p>"We're seeing - regrettably - a great deal of Russian assertiveness right now in Ukraine. So, it's not really surprising and we are doing what you'd expect us to do. We are carefully monitoring the movements of these ships when they are in Australia's approaches."</p>

						<p>Former Australian army chief Peter Leahy, now director of the National Security Institute at the University of Canberra, said the naval deployment was a "less than subtle demonstration of power".</p>

						<p>"I rather think it's likely to be pre-planned and it's more associated with the G20 meeting in Brisbane rather than the comments from the prime minister," he told national radio. "But I think Russia is sending us a message. And as I've said, it's less than subtle, but it's saying it's a maritime power, it's got global reach, it's got interests in this part of the world.</p>"

						<p>Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Russia was entitled to have ships in international waters. "So we have been aware of it for some time. We've been tracking it and as far as I know, they remain in international waters, she told reporters, without specifying the ship's exact location.</p>

						<p>The US, a key Canberra ally pursuing a "rebalance" to Asia, now rotates hundreds of marines to Australia's north, a region seen as strategic to countering China's growing military might and territorial claims in the Pacific.</p>

						<p>G20 leaders, including US President Barack Obama, meet in Brisbane on Saturday and Sunday with boosting global growth the main theme, although Ukraine is also expected to be discussed. As tensions over Ukraine have spiralled, the Soviet Union's last leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned last weekend that the world was on the "brink of a new Cold War".</p>

						<p>A recent study of Russia-West military incidents catalogued dozens of dangerous encounters this year - almost all of them linked to air and naval war games in different parts of the world including the Pacific. </p>
